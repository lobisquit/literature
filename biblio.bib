  abstract =     {A Software-defined Constrained Optimal Routing (SCOR) platform
                  is introduced as a Northbound interface in SDN architecture.
                  It is based on constraint programming techniques and is
                  implemented in MiniZinc modelling language. Using constraint
                  programming techniques in this Northbound interface has
                  created an efficient tool for implementing complex Quality of
                  Service routing applications in a few lines of code. The code
                  includes only the problem statement and the solution is found
                  by a general solver program. A routing framework is introduced
                  based on SDN's architecture model which uses SCOR as its
                  Northbound interface and an upper layer of applications
                  implemented in SCOR. Performance of a few implemented routing
                  applications are evaluated in different network topologies,
                  network sizes and various number of concurrent flows.},
