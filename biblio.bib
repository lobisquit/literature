  abstract =     {A Software-defined Constrained Optimal Routing (SCOR) platform
                  is introduced as a Northbound interface in SDN architecture.
                  It is based on constraint programming techniques and is
                  implemented in MiniZinc modelling language. Using constraint
                  programming techniques in this Northbound interface has
                  created an efficient tool for implementing complex Quality of
                  Service routing applications in a few lines of code. The code
                  includes only the problem statement and the solution is found
                  by a general solver program. A routing framework is introduced
                  based on SDN's architecture model which uses SCOR as its
                  Northbound interface and an upper layer of applications
                  implemented in SCOR. Performance of a few implemented routing
                  applications are evaluated in different network topologies,
                  network sizes and various number of concurrent flows.},

  abstract =     {Distributed software-defined networks (SDN), consisting of
                  multiple inter-connected network domains, each managed by one
                  SDN controller, is an emerging networking architecture that
                  offers balanced centralized control and distributed
                  operations. Under such networking paradigm, most existing
                  works focus on designing sophisticated
                  controller-synchronization strategies to improve joint
                  controller-decision-making for inter-domain routing. However,
                  there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of how the
                  performance of distributed SDN is related to network
                  attributes, thus impossible to justify the necessity of
                  complicated strategies. In this regard, we analyze and
                  quantify the performance enhancement of distributed SDN
                  architectures, influenced by intra-/inter-domain
                  synchronization levels and network structural properties.
                  Based on a generic weighted network model, we establish
                  analytical methods for performance estimation under four
                  synchronization scenarios with increasing synchronization
                  cost. Moreover, two of these synchronization scenarios
                  correspond to extreme cases, i.e., minimum/maximum
                  synchronization, which are, therefore, capable of bounding the
                  performance of distributed SDN with any given synchronization
                  levels. Our theoretical results reveal how network performance
                  is related to synchronization levels and inter-domain
                  connections, the accuracy of which are confirmed by
                  simulations based on both real and synthetic networks. To the
                  best of our knowledge, this is the first work quantifying the
                  performance of distributed SDN analytically, which provides
                  fundamental guidance for future SDN protocol designs and
                  performance estimation.},
