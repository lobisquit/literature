   - they don't use OpenFlow, only a custom version of a routing decision system (Quagga)
   - they used mininet instead of ns3, so less capable system (ex. mobile, ...)

   Nice, but they only do traffic classification *without* performing optimization.

   Focusing on ON-OFF packet generation processes, they built a program to do so.
   Check if there is something newer, maybe fitting some data. cite:Varet2014

  - nice analytical framework for packet generation for any distribution and autocorrelation: data needed!
  - it still suppose stationarity, linearity, ergodicity of the process

Very interesting, good analysis of the traffic (also WIDE one).
Probably I will have to replicate their results with the new data.
